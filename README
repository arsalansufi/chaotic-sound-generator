I collaborated with Kevin Jiang on this final project for Yale's Computer
Science 432: Sound Representation and Synthesis. Grad student Daniel
Winograd-Cort also helped us out, specifically with an issue upsampling audio.

For the project, we used Haskell's music library Euterpea and strange
attractors from chaos theory (often expressed as systems of differential
equations) to generate chaotic sounds. The generator uses the power of
functional programming to express the differential equations of the strange
attractors elegantly.

Check out project-description.pdf for more details. Also check out some of the
sounds that we generated in sample-sounds/. (lorentzBubbles2.wav was probably
our favorite!)
